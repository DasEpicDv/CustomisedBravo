# CustomisedBravo

This is a repo to just to help fellow devs on how to add custom items.

While developing my server **Apathos Network** i came across with features *custom items* so while figuring i found that in pocketmine dev community, it's more of a rare topic, not many devs knew about it so this just to help people who didn't knew how to make custom items yet.

***Note: This isn't mainly a plugin for normal people to use, it'll work but it's just an example-like plugin***

Make sure to check Resource Pack folder, it has the resource pack which is as important as the code.

**SUPPORTED VERSION**
Pocketmine 3.16.0 :)

[I AM THE REPO OWNER NOW! Itzdvbravo has retired from PMMP and development my discord is DasEpicDv#7068]
