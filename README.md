# CustomisedBravo

This is a repo to just to help fellow devs on how to add custom items.

While developing my server **Apathos Network** i came across with features *custom items* so while figuring i found that in pocketmine dev community, it's more of a rare topic, not many devs knew about it so this just to help people who didn't knew how to make custom items yet.

***Note: This isn't mainly a plugin for normal people to use, it'll work but it's just an example-like plugin***
